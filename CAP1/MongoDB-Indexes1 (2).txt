Indexes
Introduction
 Indexes are used by MongoDB to answer more efficiently queries.
 
Without indexes MongoDB have to scan the whole collection.
 
The idea is very similar to indexes in RDB: indexes are B-trees at the
collection level.

Default _id:
 All MongoDB collections have an index on the _id field that exists by default. If
applications do not specify a value for _id MongoDB will create an _id field with an
ObjectId value.

 The _id index is unique, and prevents clients from inserting two documents with the
same value for the _id field.

 Single Field:
 User defined index on a single field of a document.

 Compound Index:
 User defined index on multiple fields.

      Multikey Index:
 Used to index the content stored in an array. Allow you to make queries matching
      the elements of an array.
 
     Geospatial Index:
 Support queries of geospatial coordinate data.

     Text Indexes:
 Support queries of string skipping language specific stop-words.

      Hashed Indexes:
 Index the hash of the value of a field to increase randomity of distribution.
